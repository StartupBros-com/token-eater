#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-session.sh - run ONE token-eater credit-burning session end to end.
#
# The whole product in one script: preflight (isolated worktree off fresh origin/main +
# baseline gate) -> hand the chosen service a self-contained recipe (run a token-heavy skill,
# keep the gate green, self-review + fix, open a DRAFT PR) -> independently re-verify the gate.
# The service does the work on ITS OWN credits; this script is the launcher + guardrail.
#
# Usage:
#   run-session.sh --repo <path> --skill <skill-name> --gate "<cmd>" [--target "<hint>"] \
#                  [--service grok] [--rounds 2] [--slug de-monolith] [--max-turns 150] \
#                  [--pace gentle|thorough] [--dry-run]
#
# --pace thorough (default): dispatch subagents in parallel (up to 3) - the fan-out the review fleet
#        needs. Real 429s are rare (most accounts have headroom; serial pacing was suppressing the
#        fleet), and the backoff/resume net below covers a genuinely low-tier account. --pace gentle:
#        serial dispatch for an account that actually 429-storms.
# Rate-limit resilience is built in: if grok makes no progress under heavy 429s, the engine backs
# off (exponential) and RESUMES via `grok --continue`, escalating to --no-subagents.
#
# Exit: 0 = draft PR opened and gate verified green
#       2 = bad usage / preflight failure (no changes made)
#       3 = baseline gate RED (refused to run; nothing attempted)
#       4 = service ran but the final gate is RED, OR it hit the wall-clock backstop mid-run
#           (worktree kept for inspection, NO PR)
#       5 = gate green but no PR could be opened (branch kept; see log)

RECIPE="$LOG/recipe.txt"
cat > "$RECIPE" <<EOF
You are token-eater's autonomous worker for ONE session. You are inside a fresh git worktree of
the $ORIGIN_SLUG repository, on branch \`$BRANCH\` (based on origin/$BASE). Do ALL work here.

GOAL: $GOAL_LINE
Use the \`/$SKILL\` skill as your method.

THE GATE: $GATE_DESC
$DEPS_NOTE When there is a gate, run
it yourself and trust it over your own judgment.

PROCEDURE - do not stop until step 7 is done or you hit a hard blocker:

1. Run \`/$SKILL\`. Let the skill's OWN analysis pick the target(s): most maintenance skills scan
   the repo themselves to find their work - e.g. de-monolithize runs a census that RANKS monoliths
   and skips generated / justified-cohesive files; dead-code uses the gate's unused-symbol output.
   Spend real effort here (\`general-purpose\` subagents are encouraged, but dispatch them $CONC_SHORT -
   see the rate-limit rule) - choosing the right
   target IS part of the job. Do NOT fixate on one pre-chosen file. $HINT. Preserve all behavior, the public API
   surface, types, tests, validation, error handling, and security/auth. Never weaken or delete a test.

2. $GATE_STEP

3. Commit on the CURRENT branch (never \`$BASE\`):
       git add -A && git commit -m "<concise message>"

4. $REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS

5. $REGATE_STEP

6. Push the branch. Do NOT open a pull request yourself - token-eater opens the DRAFT PR itself only
   AFTER it independently re-verifies the gate, so a red-gate or non-draft PR can never appear:
       git push -u origin $BRANCH
   NEVER open a PR, NEVER merge, NEVER mark anything ready, NEVER push to \`$BASE\`.

7. $PR_DESC_STEP

FINAL OUTPUT: a summary - files changed, final gate result, how many review rounds, any nits left
for the human (token-eater opens the draft PR, using the description you wrote in step 7).

HARD RULES: stay in this worktree; keep the gate green at every commit; draft PR only; never merge;
never touch \`$BASE\`; never weaken tests, validation, error handling, or security checks; never run
package-manager installs (pnpm/npm/pip/uv/...) - dependencies are provisioned by token-eater.
