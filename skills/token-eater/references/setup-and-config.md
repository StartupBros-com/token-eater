# Setup and config

Config exists so a non-technical member types `/token-eater` and nothing else — **ever**. The first
run asks a short interactive preflight (plain language), saves the answers, and every run after that
is zero-questions. Config records only the member's *choices* (which credits, what task) — never
secrets, postures, tiers, idle windows, or reserve floors (those concepts are gone).

## Interactive preflight (asked once, then persisted)

Run the preflight when there is **no readable config** and no relevant `$ARGUMENTS`, or when the
`setup` token is passed. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** so the member clicks plain-language choices —
they never type a flag. Ask only what isn't already known:

1. **"What should I do?"** — plain-language options that map to skills (see SKILL.md's mapping table).
   Mark the safest/most-broadly-useful *(Recommended)*. → saved as `task`.
2. **"Which credits should I use?"** — only if more than one service is signed in (else pick the one
   that is, silently). Plain wording: "Claude / Grok / Codex credits". → saved as `services`.

Offer only services that `scripts/detect-adapters.sh` reports `available`. **Save the answers to
`./.token-eater.yaml`** and continue the run. Do not ask about trust as a separate question — the
member choosing to run is the consent (Claude passes `--trust-repo`; the engine remembers it per repo).

If `$ARGUMENTS` already names a service and/or skill (power user), skip the matching question(s); offer
to save them once.

## Config locations

Load config in this order; the first one found wins (a project file overrides the user default):

1. **Per-project:** `./.token-eater.yaml` in the repository where the skill is running.
2. **User-scoped:** `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/token-eater/config.yaml` (Linux / XDG).
3. **macOS fallback:** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/token-eater/config.yaml` when XDG is unset.
4. **Windows fallback:** `%APPDATA%\token-eater\config.yaml` under Windows-native Claude Code.

Write the user-scoped config by default. Write `./.token-eater.yaml` only when the user wants a different default service for one specific project. Never write secrets — config records the choice of service only.

## Schema

Schema version `2` is YAML, intentionally small enough for an agent to read and edit without a YAML library.

```yaml
version: 2
services: [grok]              # which service(s) to spend by default, in order. The first available,
                              # un-parked service does each model chore; later ones pick up the rest.
task: simplify-and-refactor-code-isomorphically  # the skill the member chose in the preflight ("what
                              # should I do?"). Persisted so /token-eater never re-asks. `setup` rewrites it.
review_before_pr: false       # optional: run one review pass before opening each draft PR
                              # (default off — review the draft PR yourself, e.g. with /ce-code-review)
stop_when_low: null           # optional/advanced: e.g. "20%" to stop spending a service when onwatch
                              # reports it near its limit. Needs onwatch; ignored if onwatch is absent.
result_dir: .token-eater/runs # where run artifacts and the ledger live (local audit trail)
```

Field meanings:

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `version` | Config schema version. Current value: `2`. An unknown version should stop and ask to re-run setup rather than guess. |
| `services` | Ordered list of service ids from `adapters.yaml` to spend. A service must also be detected before it can be used. A command-line service argument overrides this list for that run. |
| `task` | The skill chosen in the preflight (plain-language "what should I do?" → skill name). Persisted so the member is never re-asked. Omitted/empty → ask the preflight question. A skill argument overrides it for that run. |
| `review_before_pr` | When `true`, run the optional pass in `references/review-pipeline.md` before each draft PR. Default `false`. |
| `stop_when_low` | Optional balance guard, e.g. `"20%"`. Only has effect when onwatch is available (`scripts/onwatch-usage.sh`); otherwise the run simply continues until each service's circuit breaker fires. |
| `result_dir` | Repo-relative directory for run artifacts and the ledger. Defaults to `.token-eater/runs`. |

Anything not listed here (old `posture`, `tier`, `idle_window`, `reserve_floor`, `run_config`, `schedule` keys from schema v1) is obsolete. **Loading a v1 config is non-blocking:** read its `providers[].id` list, in order, as the new `services` list (so a v1 file with grok, codex, claude becomes `services: [grok, codex, claude]`), ignore every other key, and proceed with the run. Do not stop to migrate. Add one line to the run summary offering `/token-eater setup` to write a clean v2 file when convenient.

## Round-trip behavior

Every normal invocation resolves **service + task** before doing work:

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` names a service and/or skill, use them for this run.
2. Else if the `setup` token is present, run the interactive preflight (and rewrite the saved file).
3. Else if a readable config exists, load it; use its `services` and `task`. Any field it's missing,
   ask just that one preflight question.
4. Else run the interactive preflight and **persist `{services, task}` to `./.token-eater.yaml`**.
5. If config parsing fails, do not guess — report the path and the problem, and offer to re-run the
   preflight and replace the file.

The goal: after the very first run, `/token-eater` on that project asks **nothing** — it reads the
saved `{services, task}` and the engine's per-repo trust cache and just runs.

After resolving the service, the run loop still runs `scripts/detect-adapters.sh`: config is intent, detection is current capability. A service must be both chosen and currently installed to be spent.
